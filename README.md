# Contract Signing Starter

This repository contains the public setup files needed to start the Therry LLC contract signing process.

## Quick Start

### For Claude Code Users (Recommended)

1. Create a new folder for the signing session:
   ```bash
   mkdir ~/Desktop/TherryContractSigning
   cd ~/Desktop/TherryContractSigning
   ```

2. Download the settings file:
   ```bash
   curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/matznerd/contract-signing-starter/main/contract-signing-settings.json
   ```

3. Start Claude Code with the settings:
   ```bash
   claude --settings contract-signing-settings.json
   ```

4. Type `init` to begin the signing process.

Claude will guide you through:
- Installing prerequisites (GitHub CLI, GPG)
- Setting up authentication
- Cloning the private contract repository
- Completing the digital signature
